# eeg_data_collection_scripts
This directory contains the files that facilitated the collection of EEG data from the participants as they watched the simplified version of Pacman. The `v2_mwm_episode_reader.py` allows the collection of data from the Mindwave Mobile and the display of the Pacman simulation to occur concurrently. The Pacman environment congifurations can be found in `/environment/environment.py`, and the connection to and collection of data from the Mindwave Mobile was controlled by the `/environment/recorder.py` file.
